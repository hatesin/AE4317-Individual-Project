The program is run by exectuing Object_detection_image.py in the directory tensorflow1/models/research/object_detection.
The code should be executed by inputting object_detection_image.py (image path) into the terminal.

The code generates a list (objBBL) which contains the lists of coordinates of the different detected objects' bounding boxes.
The original image is also displayed with the bounding boxes drawn and the corrosponding percentage certainty labelled on the image.
